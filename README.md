Coursera Calendar
=================

**DEPRECATED:** With the new redesign of the Coursera website this extension doesn't work anymore
and there is no easy way to fix this. If someone has time and desire to take care of that -
pull requests are welcome.

About
-----

A Chrome extension that adds an icon-like link next to the list of assignment deadlines on the
[Coursera's website](https://www.coursera.org/). This link allows to add a corresponding event
to your Google Calendar.

Disclaimer
----------

It's my first and only thing I wrote in JavaScript, so when you read the code you may feel
offended by the way this extension is implemented. I warned you.
